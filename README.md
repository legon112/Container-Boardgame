# 📦 CONTAINERS

## 📖 About the Game
A board game for two and more teams and one moderator.
**Objective:** Compete in cunning, tactics, and market valuation.

## 👥 Roles & Preparation
* **Moderator:**
    * Before the game, must study the history of the containers and the approximate prices of the items inside.
    * Responsible for hyping up interest during the bidding.
    * Must keep the true value and hidden items a secret until the very end.
    * Tracks bids and declares the end of the auction.
* **Teams:** Compete against each other to buy containers for the best profit.

## 💰 Game Economy
* **Budget:** Each team starts with **$16,000**. This is the maximum amount they can spend.
* **Profit:** Each team starts with **$0**.
* **Inventory:** Start with **0** purchased containers.

## 🔄 Game Flow
A round consists of 4 stages:

### 1. Container Inspection 
* Teams read the container's backstory and view the **visible** contents.
* Other items may be hidden behind the visible ones; the full contents remain unknown until purchase.
* Teams can talk openly and react to the contents during this phase.

### 2. Tactics Discussion 
* Teams discuss their strategy privately (e.g., setting a price limit, driving up the price for opponents, or sitting out).
* **Psychological Warfare:** Bluffing is encouraged.
* Teams should not hear each other ‒ whispering, moving to different rooms, or texting is allowed.

### 3. Auction 
* The moderator announces the **Starting Price** and the **Step** (minimum increment).
* Teams can bid the starting price or raise it by at least one Step.
* Bids are accepted immediately if they meet the criteria.
* The moderator counts down from 1 to 3. After "3", the moderator must say: **"Sold!"**.

### 4. Review and Calculation 
* The winning bid amount is deducted from the team's **Budget**.
* The team's container count increases by 1.
* The moderator "sells" the items. The total value of the items is added to the team's **PROFIT** (not the budget).

## 🏆 Winning Conditions
To determine the winner, teams calculate their **Profit Coefficient**.
### 🧮 Profit Coefficient Formula

$$\text{Profit Coefficient} = \frac{\text{Total Income}}{16000 - \text{Remaining Budget}}$$

The winner is the team that satisfies **two out of the three** following conditions:
1.  **Highest Profit Coefficient:** The team with the best efficiency.
2.  **Highest Total Income:** The team with the highest total money earned from selling container contents.
3.  **Most Containers:** The team that bought and sold the contents of the highest number of containers.
